# Helios-Calendar-3.0-mysqli
This is an upgraded version of the version 3 calendar files to use the mysqli connection.
Replacement of the mysql_results function, which the mysqli version didn't fuction the same, and replced with a version to work as before.
The setup system and the calendar have been tested and are working under the new code. None of the Social Media aspects have been tested, so I cannot attest to thier funtionality.
